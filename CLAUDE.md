# Project Notes

## Documentation

- `plugin/skills/` is the **single source of truth** for all architecture documentation.
- `docs/proposed/` and `docs/completed/` track in-progress and finished implementation specs.
- `docs/diff/` contains historical diffs from the docs/architecture → plugin/skills consolidation.
